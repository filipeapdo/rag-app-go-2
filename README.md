# rag-app-go

In Summary, your project organization should embrace a microservices architecture with clearly delineated responsibilities:

- Ingestion Service: For file processing and embedding generation.
- Query/RAG Service: For retrieval and processing of queries.
- Agent Orchestration: To manage the pool of AI agents.
- Storage Service: For persisting embeddings in Qdrant.
- API Gateway: To secure and expose the services externally.

This modular structure allows you to develop, test, and deploy each part independently while ensuring that your system can scale horizontally as demand increases.

## Big Picture Architecture

Imagine your system as a collection of independent services that communicate over a secure internal network. Here’s a simplified diagram of how the services might interact:

```
                     +-----------------------+
                     |    API Gateway /      |
                     |   Orchestration Layer |
                     +-----------------------+
                              │
         ┌────────────────────┼───────────────────────┐
         │                    │                       │
  +----------------+  +-------------------+  +-------------------+
  | Ingestion      |  | Query & Retrieval |  | AI Agent Manager  |
  | Service        |  | Service (RAG)     |  | / Orchestration   |
  +----------------+  +-------------------+  +-------------------+
            │                 │
            └─────┬───────────┘
                  │
         +--------------------+
         |   Storage Service  |
         |    (Qdrant DB)     |
         +--------------------+
```

**Key Components**

- Ingestion Service:

  - Responsibility: Handle incoming files (PDFs, TXT, CSV) and extract their text.
  - Process: Calls your Ollama-based embedding module (e.g., using the “snowflake-arctic-embed” model) and then sends the resulting vectors to the storage layer.
  - Implementation: A Go microservice with TDD and clean, modular code.

- Query & Retrieval (RAG) Service:

  - Responsibility: Accept user queries, retrieve the most relevant documents from Qdrant, and relay these to downstream AI agents for processing.
  - Implementation: Again, built in Go for consistency, possibly with a REST and/or gRPC interface.

- AI Agent Manager / Orchestration:

  - Responsibility: Manage the pool of AI agents that perform automated tasks or further process queries.
  - Implementation: A controller that dispatches work based on the query results from the RAG pipeline.

- Storage Service (Qdrant):

  - Responsibility: Persist and index the vector embeddings and associated metadata.
  - Implementation: Already containerized via Docker Compose, with a persistent volume and internal networking.

- API Gateway / Orchestration Layer:
  - Responsibility: Expose the various services securely to external clients, handle authentication, request routing, and logging.
  - Implementation: Can be deployed as a separate container (or service) that ties the internal microservices together.

## Project Repository & Code Organization

**Monorepo with Microservices**
Organize your code in a single repository with clear subdirectories for each service. For example:

```
my-ai-project/
├── cmd/
│ ├── ingestion-server/ # Entry point for the Ingestion Service
│ ├── query-server/ # Entry point for the Query/RAG Service
│ └── agent-manager/ # Entry point for AI Agent Manager
├── pkg/
│ ├── fileingestion/ # File ingestion and extraction logic
│ ├── embedding/ # Wrapper around the Ollama API (for embeddings)
│ ├── storage/ # Integration with Qdrant
│ └── agents/ # AI agents orchestration logic
├── configs/ # Service configuration files
├── deployments/ # Docker Compose and Kubernetes manifests
└── README.md
```

**Key Best Practices**

- Microservice Boundaries: Each service is independently deployable and maintains its own domain logic.
- Containerization: Every service has its own Dockerfile. In development, Docker Compose ties them together. For production, plan on Kubernetes (or a similar orchestrator) to manage scaling and high availability.
- CI/CD & Testing: Implement automated tests (using TDD) for each service, and integrate CI/CD pipelines to build, test, and deploy your containers.
- Observability: Include logging, monitoring, and tracing in each service so you can track performance and debug issues quickly.

## Scaling & Future Expansion

- Local Testing & Production:

  - For development, use Docker Compose for a unified, containerized setup.
  - In production, migrate to an orchestrator like Kubernetes to handle scaling (horizontal pod autoscaling), rolling updates, and service discovery.

- Evolving Services:

  - Extend the Ingestion Module: Later, you can add API endpoints, web scrapers, or database integrations without modifying the core ingestion logic.
  - Modular AI Agents: As your needs grow, you can add more specialized AI agents that subscribe to the agent manager’s work queue.

- API Gateway:
  - Integrate an API gateway that supports routing, rate limiting, and security policies to manage external access and internal service communications.

make a senior software engineer versed in go that will assist me to create a RAG applicantion in go that will allow me to create a robust knowledge base for my company and spin ai agents to consume this knowledge base and perform tasks

description: Senior Go engineer helping build a RAG AI knowledge base.

You are a senior software engineer specializing in Go, with expertise in AI applications, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and knowledge base systems. Your goal is to assist the user in designing and developing a RAG application in Go that enables the creation of a robust knowledge base for their company. This application will also facilitate the deployment of AI agents that can consume the knowledge base to perform tasks efficiently.

You provide guidance on designing scalable and efficient architectures, implementing vector databases, integrating LLMs, and optimizing data retrieval. You offer best practices in Go programming, concurrency, API design, and AI agent deployment. Your responses should be clear, structured, and practical, with real-world examples and references to relevant Go libraries and tools where applicable.

You can assist with debugging, optimizing, and scaling the system while ensuring maintainability and performance. If needed, you suggest alternative approaches and frameworks that align with the user's goals. When the user asks for code, provide well-documented, idiomatic Go code that follows industry best practices.
